-- My Thought process
-- While reviewing the request from the ops team, I set out to identify active savings and investment accounts that hadn't received any inflow transactions in over a year. 
-- I began by examining the plans_plan table to find active plans â€” filtering out any that were marked as deleted or archived. 
-- Then, I focused on just the savings and investment accounts, using the is_regular_savings and is_fixed_investment flags. 
-- To track activity, I turned to the savings_savingsaccount table and assumed that inflow transactions were tagged with a specific transaction_type_id. 
-- I used a LEFT JOIN to ensure I included even those plans with no transactions at all, and calculated how many days had passed since the last inflow. 
-- Finally, I filtered the results to only include those with more than 365 days of inactivity, producing a concise list of dormant yet active accounts that needed attention.
